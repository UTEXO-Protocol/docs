# Node UI Actions

On the Node Page (`/node/{nodeId}`), users have access to several interactive actions: `/init`, `/lock`, `/unlock`, and `/nodeInfo`. These actions are facilitated through dedicated API Gateway routes specific to each node.

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### /nodeInfo

* Functionality: Automatically retrieves and displays the node's current status each time the node page is opened.
* Error handling: If the node is locked or encounters other issues, the UI displays an appropriate error message to inform the user.
* Use case: Provides real-time visibility into the node's status and helps diagnose any operational issues.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### /init

* Functionality: Initializes the node after its creation, making it ready for operation.
* Process:
  * During initialization, the system generates a mnemonic and provides it to the user.
  * The mnemonic is a critical security feature and must be securely saved by the user.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The mnemonic is required for recovering the node in case of future issues and for ensuring secure access in all subsequent interactions. Save it securely.
{% endhint %}

* Use case: Mandatory step after node creation to enable further actions.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### /lock

* Functionality: Secures the node by locking it, preventing unauthorized access.
* Process:
  * The user enters a password to lock the node.
  * The node remains locked until the correct password is provided to unlock it.
* Use case: Protects sensitive node operations when the node is not actively in use.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### /unlock

* Functionality: Unlocks the node, allowing it to resume normal operations.
* Process:
  * The user enters the correct password to reverse the lock status.
  * Once unlocked, the node becomes fully operational.
* Use case: Enables the user to access and manage the node after it has been secured.
